# Decision Model Helper
This is small plugin to help with a decision model in a Geodesign Project. It uses the [Geodesign Hub API](http://www.geodesignsupport.com/section/api/). The tool downloads all evaluations and builds sliders to vary transperency of the evaluations to see areas of opportunity and risk based on your preferences. 

It can be useful to understand how the decision model performs spatially and stimulate discussion in your team.

**Adding to your project**

This plugin can be added to your project using the Administration panel or at the time of creating a project.
